Introduction

An anagram is a type of wordplay; the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase using all of the original letters exactly once. For example, the word STOP can be rearranged into the words TOPS and POTS. An individual who creates anagrams is called an "anagrammatist".

You have been hired by Anagrammy to create an anagram checker program that they can use to determine whether words submitted by their users are anagrams or not for the purposes of determining a monthly contest winner. Anagrammy only wants to check word anagrams in their anagram checker and not deal with phrases for their first release. Anagrammy needs your help in order to officially release its website.
Program

Create a new Python file named Anagram_LastName. Where "LastName" is replaced by your last name. Important: The first letter of "anagram" should be capitalized along with the first letter of your last name. The rest of the file name should be lowercase. Example: Anagram_Funderburk. If you have more than one last name, use the first one that shows up in Focus.

Create a fixed variable at the top called LASTNAME and set it equal to your last name.

Students must create a function, anagram(words), that accepts one parameter, words, which will be a string of two words separated by a pipe ( | ). Your program should return True if the second word is an anagram of the first word, and False otherwise. The parameter words will be all uppercase and only contain letters.
